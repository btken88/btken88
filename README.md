# Welcome to my Github! 👋🏻

Full Stack Developer with a background in Public Arts Education and Leadership. I have a passion for creating elegant, engaging front ends, using succinct, modularized, and reusable code.

After a decade of teaching, I decided transfer the skills of developing engaging user experiences and creatively solving complex problems I honed while teaching into a career in tech. If you'd like to collaborate or chat, feel free to reach out!
